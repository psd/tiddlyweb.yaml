Exchange TiddlyWeb resources using the YAML representation:

    http://yaml.org

YAML is returned following a request for the text/yaml media type, 
or by appending a .yaml suffix before the query portion of a TiddlyWeb URI.

Resources may be created and modified by sending YAML to a TiddlyWeb
recipe, bag or tiddler URI using the text/yaml media type.

To use this code install the package and and add 'tiddlywebplugins.yaml'
to system_plugins in the tiddlywebconfig.py of your TiddlyWeb instance:

config = {
    'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.yaml'],
}
